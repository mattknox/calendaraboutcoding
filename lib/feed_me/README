Feed Me
=======

Feed Me is a simple parser for RSS2 and Atom feed, adding other feed formats should be trivial. Feed Me is pretty minimal and basically only does translation/cleanup from different feed formats to a consistent API. It is designed to be minimal.

Feed Me is built on the excellent Hpricot parser written by _why the lucky stiff.

Use it like this:

    file = File.read('some_feed.atom')
    
    feed = FeedMe.parse(file)
    
    feed.title
    feed.author.name
    feed.entries.each do |entry|
      entry.title
      entry.content
    end

Check out the specs or lib/feed_me/consts.rb for the complete API.

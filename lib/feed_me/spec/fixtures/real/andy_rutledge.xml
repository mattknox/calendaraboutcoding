				<title>Calculating Hours - the Client Factors</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>Pricing for services is one of the vital realms where design professionals
		  do not often possess significant skill. And this is a shame because price
		  estimation skill is often directly tied to a designer’s ability to keep clients
		  happy and derive a sense of satisfaction from the work; important stuff.
		  So in this article I want to examine some of the common but not oft-cited
		  factors that affect project hours’ calculations and how these factors affect our pricing
	    considerations, all in an effort to help designers avoid pricing mistakes.</p>]]>

				<title>Poynter's Eye-tracking Follies</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>Poynter released their EyeTrack ’07 study findings some months ago
		    and while this effort was not a completely useless study like their previous
		    one, I thought it would be good to revisit how these sorts of studies can
		    unnecessarily distract us in our design efforts. What follows is an updated,
		    edited, and expanded version of my previously published article on Poynter’s
	    Eyetrack III study.</p>]]>

				<title>A Sense of Non-Commitment</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>I think that there’s a disconnect or disharmony in motivations and
          a certain obliviousness to (or ignorance of) facts among many designers.
          I think that many designers believe that building a reputation as a
          designer is the same thing as building a reputation as a professional.
          It’s not; certainly not as demonstrated by many designers.</p>]]>

				<title>How and Why: Styling Text Links</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>Poorly styled text links can detract 
				from or ruin an otherwise well-designed page, while appropriately styled 
				text links can add significant support to the brand and enhance the user 
				experience. Since text links are a significant feature of the online experience,
				it’s an element of design worth getting right.</p>]]>

				<title>My Teacher</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>Ongoing education is something I expect all designers who are long out
		  of school crave. Of course many of us work to educate ourselves daily by
		  various means, but the luckiest among us have teachers or mentors who provide
		  hands-on instruction on some regular basis. Last week my teacher came for
	    his annual visit and I’m still reeling from the experience.</p>]]>

				<title>A Brand Synopsis</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>I probably should have read a few brand promises from other companies
	      before resolving that ours is &#8220;done&#8221; or &#8220;right,&#8221; but we believe that we’re
	      somewhat unique as a company, in many respects. So we’re going with this
	      one. Therefore, this is something of a blind study. I hope it might spark
	      some thought on the subject and hope that it might even help others working
	      on similar efforts.</p>]]>

				<title>Falling Down</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a martial arts student for a couple of decades and in that time
		  I’ve known quite a few others who were brilliant technicians and were otherwise
		  formidable individuals, but lacked a fundamental skill set: the ability to
		  fall safely and gracefully. This is a grave omission, because training with
		  the belief that things will always go well and as-planned is delusional.
		  Delusion is not a sound context for any serious endeavor; like design, for
	    instance.</p>]]>
